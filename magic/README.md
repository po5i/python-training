# Duck Typing

The main idea of duck typing is that it doesn't matter what type the data is, if it does what I need I can use it. Since Python does not use interfaces, we can use multiple inheritance and duck typing. 

This example demonstrates that a `Car` instance can be injected any dependency that implements a `start()` method. After the car invokes the `turn_on()` method the engine starts and it prints how many pistons are running (should be the same as the number of cylinders).

# Magic Methods

Python offers lots of magic methods, this example demonstrates the use of:

- `__name__`: To get the name of the current class, function, module, descriptor or generator.
- `__class__`: To get the class of an instance
- `__repr__`: To get the official string representation of an object, useful for development. Called by the `repr()` method.
- `__str__`: To get the printable string representation of an object. Called by the `str()` method.


## Run the exercise
